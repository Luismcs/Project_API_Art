# Project Description

This is a web project that utilizes an artwork API to create a platform for viewing arts and purchasing products. The site has two main pages: the artworks page and the products page.

## Artworks Page

On the artworks page, users can view a list of all available artworks. The main features include:

- **Artworks Viewing**: Users can view all available artworks in a user-friendly interface.
- **Pagination System**: To facilitate navigation, artworks are displayed with a pagination system, allowing users to explore multiple pages of artworks.
- **Artworks Search**: Users can search for specific artworks using the search feature.

## Products Page

On the products page, users can find selected art pieces for purchase. The main features include:

- **Products Viewing**: Users can view a selection of products available for purchase.
- **Pagination System**: Similar to the artworks page, products are displayed with a pagination system.
- **Redirection to Purchase Page**: Each product has a button that directs users to the specific product's purchase page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the user interface and client-side interactions.
- **Artwork API**: An external API is used to provide the data of artworks and products (https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction). 
- **Pagination System**: Implemented to enhance user experience when dealing with large datasets.
